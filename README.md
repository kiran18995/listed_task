## Getting Started
Directly through this link for APK: [APK](https://github.com/kiran18995/listed_task/tree/5963bfe3bb5944782b6cf08883fdcb77fb100e39/APK)

### Displaying Greetings from Local Time

I have added greetings that will show from local time.

### Displaying Name from API

The name which is showing here is hardcoded because the name is not available in the given API.

### Creating a Chart from API Response

The chart used here is "mpandroidchart." find below the link for the library.

I have used a recycler view and two text views for the tabs as it is showing only 5 lists. If the user wants more user will click on view all links, so I made minimal complexity.
```diff

- Added splash screen
- Added loading
- added WhatsApp message for "Talk with us"
